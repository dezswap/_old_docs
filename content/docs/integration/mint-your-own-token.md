## Introduction

This token contract is implemented under the CW20 standard and it fully supports **Dezswap** feature.
Except for any function of your token itself contains more than an asset, we recommend minting your own token by **instantiating this binary**, rather than developing your own.

{{< tip >}}
**NOTE**

We strongly encourage you to create by the pre-stored binary.\
There are some advantages below:

* These token, pair contract codes are well audited and continuously maintained. Don't have to audit for yours additionally.
* **Dezswap** only lists Token factory-created pairs.
* You don't have to migrate your contract whenever there is any major upgrade of XPLA Chain. **Dezswap** will help you to migrate so that you don't have to take any action.

Please check [Contract addresses]({{< relref "/docs/resources/contract-addresses" >}}) page.

## How to Mint

#### 1. Using Deployed Token Factory (Recommended)

The standard CW20 token is already stored in XPLA Chain.\
The code is wrapped based on cw20 [v0.13.2](https://docs.rs/cw20/0.13.2/cw20/index.html) \
Please check [here]({{< relref "/docs/resources/contract-addresses" >}}) for the more addresses.

You may instantiate your own token using the JSON as follows:

```json
{
    "name": "yout_token_name",
    "symbol": "SYMBOL",
    "decimals": 6,
    "initial_balances": [
        {
            "address": "xpla10001asdfsdfbqwer...",
            "amount": "10000"
        },
        {
            "address": "xpla10002asdfsdfbqwer...",
            "amount": "10000"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

Then, the CLI reads:

```bash
xplad tx wasm instantiate <token_bin_code> '{"name": "yout_token_name", "symbol": "SYMBOL", "decimals": 6, ... }' --from your_key
```

After confirmation, your token is minted on the XPLA Chain!

With your tx hash, you may query the tx:

```bash
xplad query tx EF2REFAWE234A2EFV....
```

Then, you may find the address of your contract from the event logs:

```json
{
    "key": "contract_address",
    "value": "xpla18vd8fpwxzck93qlwghaj6arh4p7c5n896xzem5"
}
```

#### 2. Implement by Yourself

First, you should implement at least these messages.

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum Cw20ExecuteMsg {
    /// Transfer is a base message to move tokens to another account without triggering actions
    Transfer { recipient: String, amount: Uint128 },
    /// Burn is a base message to destroy tokens forever
    Burn { amount: Uint128 },
    /// Send is a base message to transfer tokens to a contract and trigger an action
    /// on the receiving contract.
    Send {
        contract: String,
        amount: Uint128,
        msg: Binary,
    },
    /// Only with "approval" extension. Allows spender to access an additional amount tokens
    /// from the owner's (env.sender) account. If expires is Some(), overwrites current allowance
    /// expiration with this one.
    IncreaseAllowance {
        spender: String,
        amount: Uint128,
        expires: Option<Expiration>,
    },
    /// Only with "approval" extension. Lowers the spender's access of tokens
    /// from the owner's (env.sender) account by amount. If expires is Some(), overwrites current
    /// allowance expiration with this one.
    DecreaseAllowance {
        spender: String,
        amount: Uint128,
        expires: Option<Expiration>,
    },
    /// Only with "approval" extension. Transfers amount tokens from owner -> recipient
    /// if `env.sender` has sufficient pre-approval.
    TransferFrom {
        owner: String,
        recipient: String,
        amount: Uint128,
    },
    /// Only with "approval" extension. Sends amount tokens from owner -> contract
    /// if `env.sender` has sufficient pre-approval.
    SendFrom {
        owner: String,
        contract: String,
        amount: Uint128,
        msg: Binary,
    },
    /// Only with "approval" extension. Destroys tokens forever
    BurnFrom { owner: String, amount: Uint128 },
    /// Only with the "mintable" extension. If authorized, creates amount new tokens
    /// and adds to the recipient balance.
    Mint { recipient: String, amount: Uint128 },
    /// Only with the "marketing" extension. If authorized, updates marketing metadata.
    /// Setting None/null for any of these will leave it unchanged.
    /// Setting Some("") will clear this field on the contract storage
    UpdateMarketing {
        /// A URL pointing to the project behind this token.
        project: Option<String>,
        /// A longer description of the token and it's utility. Designed for tooltips or such
        description: Option<String>,
        /// The address (if any) who can update this data structure
        marketing: Option<String>,
    },
    /// If set as the "marketing" role on the contract, upload a new URL, SVG, or PNG for the token
    UploadLogo(Logo),
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum Cw20QueryMsg {
    /// Returns the current balance of the given address, 0 if unset.
    /// Return type: BalanceResponse.
    Balance { address: String },
    /// Returns metadata on the contract - name, decimals, supply, etc.
    /// Return type: TokenInfoResponse.
    TokenInfo {},
    /// Only with "allowance" extension.
    /// Returns how much spender can use from owner account, 0 if unset.
    /// Return type: AllowanceResponse.
    Allowance { owner: String, spender: String },
    /// Only with "mintable" extension.
    /// Returns who can mint and the hard cap on maximum tokens after minting.
    /// Return type: MinterResponse.
    Minter {},
    /// Only with "marketing" extension
    /// Returns more metadata on the contract to display in the client:
    /// - description, logo, project url, etc.
    /// Return type: MarketingInfoResponse.
    MarketingInfo {},
    /// Only with "marketing" extension
    /// Downloads the embedded logo data (if stored on chain). Errors if no logo data stored for
    /// this contract.
    /// Return type: DownloadLogoResponse.
    DownloadLogo {},
    /// Only with "enumerable" extension (and "allowances")
    /// Returns all allowances this owner has approved. Supports pagination.
    /// Return type: AllAllowancesResponse.
    AllAllowances {
        owner: String,
        start_after: Option<String>,
        limit: Option<u32>,
    },
    /// Only with "enumerable" extension
    /// Returns all accounts that have balances. Supports pagination.
    /// Return type: AllAccountsResponse.
    AllAccounts {
        start_after: Option<String>,
        limit: Option<u32>,
    },
}

/// We currently take no arguments for migrations
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct MigrateMsg {}
```

Then, compile your contract using it.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.12.8

```

Because the size of WASM file consumes over 1 MiB and this contract cannot be deployed due to binary size restriction. (512KiB)
