Click the button, and a wallet selection window will be displayed. Select a wallet installed in your environment and allow the connection from the wallet. If you want to know more about wallet support on the XPLA Chain, visit here [XPLA Docs](https://docs.xpla.io/docs/learn/xpla-vault/)

Once Dezswap connects with your wallet, the "Connect wallet" button will be updated to **My wallet**, providing brief information about your wallet. You can copy your address or check on the [XPLA explorer](https://explorer.xpla.io/)
