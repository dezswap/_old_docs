**Dezswap** is a [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)-inspired automated market-maker (AMM) protocol implemented with smart contracts on the XPLA Chain. This enables a decentralized on-chain exchange for the various assets involved in XPLA Chain's ecosystem.

## Participants

Users can participate in **Dezswap** as traders, liquidity providers, or both.

#### Trader

A *trader* can exchange their tokens for other tokens through **Dezswap** using the price determined by the liquidity pool ratio.

#### Liquidity Provider

A *liquidity provider* adds equal value of two assets to their corresponding **Dezswap** pair pool, increasing the liquidity for the corresponding pair market while maintaining the pool price. In this process, liquidity providers are rewarded by newly minted LP tokens. LP tokens represent the liquidity provider's share in the pool and provide the benefit of earning trading fees, which are accumulated into the pool on every swap transaction. Liquidity providers can burn their LP tokens to withdraw their share from the pool.
